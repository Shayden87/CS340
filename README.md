How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

***/ The best way to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to follow
best practices in commenting code and creating the code itself. One should also create programs incrementally
and modularly. /***  

What were the advantages of working in this way? 

***/  This allows you and other programers to know what each
part of the program does if they need to go back and make updates.
Incrementally creating code allows for easier testing and maintenance as a project proceeds.
Modular code creation allows the code to be reused if necessary. /*** 
 
 How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
 
 ***/ This Python module is simply a good module for the manipulation of any MongoDB database. It could 
 be used in conjunction with any existing database to create,read,update,and delete documents within a
 database. /***
 
 How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
 
 ***/ As a computer scientist we approach problems with a specific plan. We then proceed to utilize the
 scientific method to implement the plan to test, receive results, analyze those results, and generate 
 further strategies to solve the problem.
 /***
 
 How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
 
 ***/
 For this project I did more research before heading in to implement any type of strategy. I wanted to have 
 a better understanding of how the database was utilized and accessed before proceeding with testing and analyzing results.
 /***
 
 What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
 
 ***/ In the creation of other client requested databases I would gather as much information as possible from the client
 about their current database needs and future needs. Finding out how the want to store and access their information is 
 important. Knowing how they may need room for expansion is also important as it will determine what type of database will
 be best for their needs.
 /***
 
 What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 
 
 ***/ Computer scientists utilize technology to solve problems of various kinds. This is important as we have to learn how to
 utilize and improve these tools to advance technological capabilities. This allows expansion in other important fields like 
 medicine, manufacturing, etc. 
 /***
 
 How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
 
 ***/ Any improvement to company processes will allow for more work to be done more quickly and easily. This saves a 
 company time and money. It allows for other processes to be focused on and improved as well.
